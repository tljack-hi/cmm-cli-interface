## Masternode Setup

There are 6 steps to create the MN

Step 1) Create the MN server. Get root password and ipaddress

Step 2) Setup passwordless ssh using root password and ipaddress

Step 3) Prepare the MN server

Step 4) Setup the wallet with the MN details. Get [mngenkey] and MN alias.

Step 5) Finish the MN server using [mngenkey].

Step 6) Start MN on wallet computer ./commercium-cli startalias mn27

# Masternode Monitoring

## List Caddr from Masternode.conf

Let's create a list of our MN caddrs using the masternode.conf file.

The masternode.conf file is located at ~/.commercium/masternode.conf

And if you have one masternode, it will look something like this:

`#Format: alias IP:port masternodeprivkey collateral_output_txid collateral_output_index
mn01 123.123.132.147:2019 5SaWpQgjtjL2yx5ig574zkNxUmaFNySZwRYDpKkBN6fMeydoaEWS 35c99d65ea1c75ad1d02e49e029901401351f7732d547433e146b057fd963bf51
mn02 123.123.132.142:2019 5haWpQgjtjL2yx5ig574zkNxUmaFNySZwRYDpKkBN6fMeydoaSyf 53c99d65ea1c75ad1d02e49e029901401351f7732d547433e146b057fd963jkd12`

### txidtocaddress.py

```
cat << 'EOF' > txidtocaddress.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# usage: python3 txidtocaddress.py collateral_output_txid
#
# Find the caddress associated with the collateral_output_txid in masternode.conf
# To see the json structure use ./commercium-cli help gettransaction
#

import subprocess
import json
import sys

txid=str(sys.argv[1])

command = "./commercium-cli gettransaction \"" + txid + "\""

response = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, universal_newlines=True)
data = json.loads( response )

i = 0
while i < len(data["details"]):
    if ( data["details"][i]["amount"] == 100000.0 ):
        print ( data["details"][i]["address"] )
    i += 1
EOF
```

Using your masternode.conf file you can find the  caddr of the masternode by running the command where collateral_output_txid is from your masternode.conf file.

`python3 txidtocaddress.py collateral_output_txid`

So, let's see it work: In the same directory as you have commercium-cli and the above txidtocaddress.py - copy and paste this to your command line.

```
cat << 'EOF' > listmasternodes-simple.sh

#!/bin/bash

while read in;
do

#    echo $in

        #ignore comments or blank lines (not quite right for blank lines)
    comment=echo $in | grep "^#"
    if [ -z "$comment" -a "$in" != "" ]; then

        alias=`echo -n $in | awk '{ print $1; }'`

        collateral_output_txid=echo -n $in | awk '{ print $4; }'

        caddress=python3 txidtocaddress.py $collateral_output_txid

        echo -n $alias " " $caddress

        amount=./commercium-cli z_getbalance "$caddress";

        total=awk -v total="$total" -v amount="$amount" 'BEGIN {printf("%19.8f", total+amount)}'
        printf " %19.8f\n" $amount
    fi

done < ~/.commercium/masternode.conf
EOF
chmod +x listmasternodes-simple.sh
```
## Move MN Generated CMM to a Caddr

MN rewards are sent to the caddr that holds the initial 100000 coins used to setup the MN. These reward CMMs, however, cannot be accessed directly but first must be sent to a shielded zaddr and then to a transparent caddr.

So we are talking about one or more caddr (caddrs) where the reward coins are, cadder_main where we want the coins to go, and zaddr an intermediate address we use to move the coins. So we are going to move the coins as:

    caddrs -> zaddr -> caddr_main

So this example will work if you have one or more masternodes.
Step 1) Get a zaddr which will be used to temporarily hold the CMM
To get a zaddr, either use an existing zaddr or create a new one.

To use an existing zaddr, display a list of all available zaddrs and pick one. To do this use the command:

    ./commercium-cli z_listaddresses

Or to create a new zaddr, use the command:

    ./commercium-cli z_getnewaddress

With either method you will have a zaddr that you can use to send the CMM rewards.

**Step 2)** See what is in the zaddr

./commercium-cli z_getbalance zaddr

**Step 3)** Move the CMM to zaddr:

For safety, start by moving a little bit and making sure it works as you expect.

Let's start by moving 1 UXTOs (usually 1.8 CMM) to the zaddress:

`./commercium-cli z_shieldcoinbase "*" "zaddr" 0.0001 1`

Confirm that the transfer worked (this does take time) by using the z_getbalance command from Step 2.

Once you are sure this is working right, you can move all (well alot) of CMM with a single command:

./commercium-cli z_shieldcoinbase "*" "zaddr" 0.0001 5000

**Step 4)** See what happened:

./commercium-cli z_getoperationstatus

**Step 5)** Have an adult beverage and chillax.

**Step 6)** Take a peek at the zaddr and see if the CMM are there:

./commercium-cli z_getbalance zaddr

if 0.0000, go to Step 5

Otherwise, note down the number, say it is 1111.1112 CMM

**Step 7)** Send the coins in zaddr to your destination commercium address (caddr_main)

You are going to send the zaddr balance CMM minus the "fee" of .0001 CMM.

So 1111.1112 - .0001 = 1111.1111 <- that is the amount we send:

`$ ./commercium-cli z_sendmany "zaddr" "[{\"amount\": 1111.1111, \"address\": \"caddr_main\"}]"`

Note that once you have gone through all of this, most of the steps can be skipped. Once you have a working zaddr, you can use this same address all of the time. And with this you will just need to basically run the three command:

```
$ ./commercium-cli z_shieldcoinbase "*" "zaddr" 0.0001 5000
$ ./commercium-cli z_getbalance zaddr
CMM_BALANCE
$ ./commercium-cli z_sendmany "zaddr" "[{\"amount\": CMM_BALANCE-.0001, \"address\": \"caddr_main\"}]"
```
## Check Command Status with OPID

If a command like z_shieldcoinbase returns an opid, that opid can be used to find out more about the status of the command.

Suppose we run the command:

```
$ ./commercium-cli z_shieldcoinbase "*" "zcE1ZcsGbrUwBike2gFnhLwLerHkqQmQtizK6wyGeJRAViDxwxEuJpLj6rpPZzcantBxqfSWRP4CwvEUjjUoaA7HZ3RSLNH" 0.0001 5000
{
  "remainingUTXOs": 0,
  "remainingValue": 0.00000000,
  "shieldingUTXOs": 3,
  "shieldingValue": 5.40000000,
  "opid": "opid-e21030af-048b-48b7-8408-6ee5417e280d"
}
```
Notice that an opid is returned. We can find out more about the command by examining that opid. This is done by:

`$ ./commercium-cli z_getoperationstatus '["opid-e21030af-048b-48b7-8408-6ee5417e280d"]'`

## z_getbalance

**Usage:** z_getbalance "address" ( minconf )

Returns the balance of a taddr or zaddr belonging to the node's wallet.

CAUTION: If the wallet has only an incoming viewing key for this address, then spends cannot be detected, and so the returned

    ./commercium-cli z_getbalance "myaddress" 5

balance may be larger than the actual balance.

Arguments:
1. "address" (string) The selected address. It may be a transparent or private address.
2. minconf (numeric, optional, default=1) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.

Result:

amount (numeric) The total amount in CMM received for this address.

Examples:

The total amount received by address "myaddress"

`$ ./commercium-cli z_getbalance "myaddress"`

The total amount received by address "myaddress" at least 5 blocks confirmed

`$ ./commercium-cli z_getbalance "myaddress" 5`
